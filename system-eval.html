<h3>System Introduction</h3>
<p>The Alexandria City Public Library’s online library system is simple and easy to navigate. The Alexandria Library is my local public library, and I am a frequent user of both their physical and online resources. Founded in 1794 as the Alexandria Library Company, the Alexandria Library became a free public library in 1931. In 1934, it was the site of one of the earliest sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1982, the library’s catalog went digital. In 1996, the library launched its first website.</p>

<p>Since these early days, the library system has expanded to serve over 1.4 million visitors and web users annually. The library’s website reflects the institution as a community resource meant to serve a broad, diverse group of users. Anybody who lives, works or attends school in Alexandria City is eligible for a free library card, and residents in neighboring areas (such as Arlington County, Fairfax County, and Washington, D.C.) can apply for a card as well.</p>
<p>The library’s website is large, containing many sections and web pages. This reflects the wide range of services the library offers. As one navigates the site, the catalog search box remains at the top of the page, so it is always accessible.</p>
<p>The same is true of the main menu, which contains the following sections:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Books & More</li>
    <li>Events</li>
    <li>Services</li>
    <li>Kids</li>
    <li>Teens</li>
    <li>Locations</li>
    <li>How Do I?</li>
    <li>Log In</li>
</ul>
<p>The library’s homepage is mainly focused on community engagement. The library’s events calendar and YouTube channel are prominently featured, as are links to pages containing guides for accessing and using certain services. These include signing up for a library card, signing up for an appointment to apply for a passport, and instructions for digitally accessing eBooks, music, databases and online learning programs. At the bottom of the homepage, there is a section titled “Community Resources,” which contains links to organizations outside of the library that provide free resources. These include Alexandria’s Department of Community & Human Services, the Alexandria Health Department and the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
<p>The library collection itself contains a wide range of materials, including books, DVDs, audiobooks, chromebooks, mobile hotspots, thermal cameras, American Girl Dolls, and more. For books, the online catalog contains basic identifying information (title, author, year published), an image of the book’s cover, the number of available copies as well as the number of holds, and the library location(s) where the book can be physically found. A logged-in user can place a hold on a book by clicking a blue “PLACE HOLD” button located in the upper right corner of each listing.</p>

<h3>System Discussion</h3>
<p>There are many useful features the Alexandria Library system supports, all of which demonstrate the library’s commitment to serving as many community members as possible. There are multiple reading guides to help users find a book to read, across multiple age groups, genres and categories. The “kids” and “teens” sections have recommendations targeted to those specific demographics, along with homework help.</p>
<p>The library system also includes tutorials specifically to help digital users access services from home. There are video tutorials instructing users on how to access library databases remotely. The library also clearly notes which of over 80 databases can be accessed from home, and which can only be accessed from a physical library location. The library has also created tutorials for accessing their online learning programs, such as Mango Languages.</p>
<p>Overall, the Alexandria Library’s online system is cohesive and user friendly. It does feel a little overwhelming sometimes, simply because of the large number of services and resources the library offers. For improvement, I would suggest incorporating a live-chat feature that allows digital users to ask librarians questions in real time.</p>
